The text in the image is: "A citation is both a signpost and an acknowledgement. As a signpost, it signals a location of your source. As an acknowledgement, it reveals that you are indebted to that source. A citation can appear in different formats- within the text (in-text citation) at the bottom of the page (footnote), or at the end of the page (endnote). Different disciplines are different formats. The mechanics of citing are similar, though they vary in each format. To answer specific questions about the mechanics of citation, please consult sources describing each type. You may find it most useful to think about how citations function as a way for you as a writer to communicate with your readers. By using citations, you keep readiers opened whose idea or words you are using in any given in each document can be traceable. Three Reasons Why Citation is Important Citaion is importanacaues is the basis of academics, that is the pursuit of knowledge. In the academic endeavor, individuals look at evidence and reason about that evidence. They are the tools of the trade and evidence that they evidence that they reuse individual ways. That is, by taking in already known, credible, or thought, they use their reasoning power to create new knowledge".

The image appears to be a page from a question bank, likely for a college or university level course. The page is divided into two main sections: a question section and an answer section.

**Question Section:**

*   The question is titled "Question bank CIDT" and has a unique identifier "UNIT3."
*   The question is: "Q.1) What are the fundamental principles outlined in the codes of research ethics?"
*   The instructions for answering the question are unclear, as they are in English and Chinese, but it seems to be asking for a summary of the ethical principles outlined in various research ethics codes.

**Answer Section:**

*   The answer is titled "UNIT3" and has a unique identifier "UNIT3."
*   The answer is: "Q.1) What are the fundamental principles outlined in the codes of research ethics?
    *   Given the importance of ethics for the conduct of research, it should come as no surprise that many different professional associations, government agencies, and universities have adopted specific codes, rules, and policies relating to research ethics.
    *   Many governmental-agencies, such as the National Institute of Health (NIH), the National Science Foundation (NSF), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the Department of Agriculture (USDA) have ethics rules for funded researchers. Other influential research ethics policies include the Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals (The International Committee of Medical Journal Editors), the Chemist's Code of Conduct (American Chemical Society), Code of Ethics (American Society for Clinical Laboratory Science), Code of Ethics (American Association of Psychologists), Code of Professional Conduct (American Association of University Professors), Helsinki Code (World Medical Association), Hippocratic Oath (World Medical Association), Charter on Professional Responsibilities to the Public (Professional Associations of Health Professionals), Statement on Professional Ethics (American Association of Dental Surgeons), Nuremberg Code (World Medical Association), and the Declaration of Helsinki (World Medical Association). The following is a tough and general summary of some ethical principles that various codes address*:
        1.    Honesty: Strive for honesty in all scientific communications. Honestly report data, results, methods and procedures, and publication status. Do not fabricate, falsify, or misrepresent data. Do not deceive colleagues, granting agencies, or the public.
        2.    Objectivity: Strive to avoid bias in experimental design, data analysis, data interpretation, peer review, and informed decision-making. Grant writing, expert testimony, and other aspects of research objectivity are expected or required. Avoid or minimize bias or self-deception. Disclose personal or financial interests that may affect research.
        3.    Integrity: Keep your promises and agreements; act with sincerity; strive for consistency of thought and action.
        4.    Carefulness: Avoid careless errors and negligence; carefully and critically examine your own work and the work of your peers. Keep good records of research activities, such as data collection, research design, and correspondence with agencies or journals.
        5.    Openness: Share data, results, ideas, tools, resources. Be open to criticism and new ideas."

The answer section outlines five fundamental principles of research ethics: honesty, objectivity, integrity, carelessness, and openness. These principles are intended to guide researchers in conducting their work in an ethical and responsible manner. The passage also mentions various codes of conduct and principles that have been adopted by different organizations and institutions, such as the National Science Foundation, the Food and Drug Administration, and the American Medical Association. Overall, the question and answer sections provide a clear understanding of the importance of ethics in research and the various principles that guide researchers in their work.

Response for page1.jpg:
The text in the image appears to be a self-introduction for a researcher, specifically highlighting their work at the 85th Annual Meeting of the Association for Psychological Science (APS). Key aspects of the researcher's work include:

* Research on unconscious social behavior in humans
* Focus on understanding the neural mechanisms underlying these unconscious biases
* Study on the impact of unconscious biases on decision-making and problem-solving

The image is likely a photograph of the researcher speaking at the conference, with the text providing context for their presentation.

The image appears to contain two sections of text, which appear to be excerpts from a webpage describing legal information surrounding copyrights. Unfortunately, due to the image quality and the formatting of the text, the retrieval process is challenging. The text is too distorted, and it's not clear if any text could be retrieved.

It is not possible to extract any text from the image as it is not legible.

Response for page2.jpg:
The image displays a page of research rules and guidelines, presented in black text on a beige background. 

The list begins by warning against informing a collaborator of your intent to file a patent in order to make sure that you are the sole inventor. Rules and guidelines for maintaining the integrity of research papers follow, including keeping good research records and proper citation of other people's work.
